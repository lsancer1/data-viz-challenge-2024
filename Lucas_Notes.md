## Structres of Networks Json

Pretty basic. The GeoJson files don't have extra information.

- Postes Electriques:

- Pylones and Postes have the same type:

- Lignes, not check comprehensively but I feel like they have same structures except the geometry string values

### TDL Next Time

- [Dash 20min tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial) and or  Graphana basic tuto such as [fundamentals docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/) or [Getting started with Grafana dashboard design](https://grafana.com/go/webinar/getting-started-with-grafana-dashboard-design/?pg=videos&plcmt=ondemand) from the webinar section [here](https://grafana.com/videos/)
- Start to retrieve basic info from METEO FRANCE
- Import jsons data and plot all points in a Cosrica map - check what the coordinates correspond to
- Whenever we will have different "maps" layout we will need to deal with coordinates system that can vary
- Should start to have "clear" idea of who do what
