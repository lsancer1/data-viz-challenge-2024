### TDL Next Time

- [Dash 20min tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial) and or  Graphana basic tuto such as [fundamentals docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/) or [Getting started with Grafana dashboard design](https://grafana.com/go/webinar/getting-started-with-grafana-dashboard-design/?pg=videos&plcmt=ondemand) from the webinar section [here](https://grafana.com/videos/)
- Start to retrieve basic info from METEO FRANCE
- Import jsons data and plot all points in a Cosrica map - check what the coordinates correspond to
- Whenever we will have different "maps" layout we will need to deal with coordinates system that can vary
- Should start to have "clear" idea of who do what

## 18th September 

- not able to do much in 1h30 , need to start at the latest at 18h30 on Wednesdays.... :'(

- Play with Alberto code and set my repo in a proper way, conda env, configs, utils.

- Defining guideline and propositon to split work on shared notes 

- Shared notes

  One should care about the reseaux data fully and the implementation in dashboard, then we split the environmental risks between us 2. We should define tasks from now. 

  Peut etre faire un tableau avec, Données Réseaux Affichées, API pour données Environmentale, Données Environmentale, Seuil d'alerte, Niveau de Guidelines.
